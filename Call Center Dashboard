Power BI Dashboard Tutorial: 

Call Center Trend Analysis

🎯 Objective
To track and analyze the performance of call center agents, 
call handling efficiency, customer satisfaction, and 
topic-wise issue resolution using interactive visuals.

This type of dashboard is commonly used to monitor agent performance, 
call outcomes, and customer experience trends in a call center environment.


📊 Key Sections of the Dashboard

1. KPIs at the Top
Total Calls, Answered, Rejected, Resolved, and Unresolved Calls are displayed using KPI tiles.
Two percentage metrics:
% Calls Answered = Answered / Total
% Calls Resolved = Resolved / Total
Icons (📞, ❌, ✅) are used to enhance visual comprehension.
🔧 How to Create: Use Card visual for each metric and set custom icons via conditional formatting or Unicode.

2. Filters/Slicers
Dropdown slicers allow users to filter by:
Topic
Month
Virtual Case Experience
🔧 How to Create: Use Slicer visual, connected to appropriate columns in your data model.

3. Gauge Visual: Avg vs Target Rating
Displays current average rating versus a target (e.g., 4.40).
Helps monitor customer satisfaction.
🔧 Use: Gauge visual, bind it to a measure like Average(Rating) and set a target manually.

4. Trend Line: Total Calls by Month
Shows how call volume changes over time.
Ideal for identifying peak and low seasons.
🔧 Use: Line chart, with Month on X-axis and Total Calls on Y-axis.

5. Donut Chart: Average Rating by Agent
Displays how each agent is rated by customers.
Easy comparison of individual performance.
🔧 Use: Donut chart, bind Agent to legend and Average(Rating) as value.

6. Bar Chart: Answered vs Resolved Calls by Agent
Dual-series comparison for each agent.
Identifies discrepancies between answering and resolving.
🔧 Use: Clustered bar chart, with Agent on axis, two measures (Answered, Resolved) as values.



7. Stacked Bar: Answered vs Resolved Calls by Topic
Breaks down calls by topic and outcome.
Shows performance by issue type.
🔧 Use: 100% Stacked Bar Chart, with Topic as axis and Call Type as legend.

8. Ribbon Chart: Resolved Calls by Agent and Topic
A ribbon-style visual highlighting how different topics are resolved by agents.
Emphasizes volume and variety of topics per agent.
🔧 Use: Ribbon chart, with Agent as axis, Resolved Calls as value, and Topic as legend.

9. Slicer: Agent Distribution
Visualizes volume or count of calls per agent in a block-style layout.
🔧 Use: Treemap, with Agent as group and Total Calls or Resolved Calls as value.

🧠 Key Learnings for Power BI Users
Use KPI Cards and Gauge Charts to show progress toward goals.
Employ slicers for interactivity.
Utilize dual bar charts for comparison metrics (Answered vs Resolved).
Combine visuals and icons for intuitive storytelling.
Maintain consistent color schemes to represent call outcomes or agents.

🔧 Tips to Recreate This Dashboard
Prepare the Data Model
Ensure date columns are in date format.
Use a separate Date table for filtering.
Create Measures in DAX
Total Calls = COUNT('Call Centre Records'[Answered (Y/N)])
Calls answered = IF('Call Centre Records'[Answered (Y/N)]="y",1,0)
Total Calls Answered = SUM('Call Centre Records'[Calls answered])
calls not answered = IF('Call Centre Records'[Answered (Y/N)] = "N",1,0)
Total Calls Not answered = SUM('Call Centre Records'[calls not answered])
% calls not answered = DIVIDE([Total Calls Not answered],[Total Calls])
Build and Format Visuals
Add icons using Unicode in titles or cards.
Format visuals to use same font and style for consistency.
Use tooltips for extra context (e.g., agent details or call breakdown).
